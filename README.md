# Symmetry-based Regularization in Deep Breast Cancer Screening
This repository contains all the code used for the experiments of the paper Symmetry-based Regularization in Deep Breast Cancer Screening (currently under review).

To reproduce results on a different system, the paths for the location of the data and the location of where to save the model must be changed.

Scripts used to train and evaluate are provided in "examples/works_in_regularization/"
